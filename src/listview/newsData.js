            + 'here.</p><p>What should people know about application security in the .NET Framework? Why is it important?'
            + '</p><p>Microsoft’s .NET Framework ushered a new era of rapid application development that was almost as powerful as'
            + 'C/C++ development on one hand, but did not have as many sharp edges and opportunities to "shoot yourself in the'
            + 'foot" on the other hand. The unfortunate side effect was that .NET developers\' efforts were mostly spent'
            + 'discovering and calling the APIs provided by the .NET ecosystem, not learning how to use these APIs correctly. Many'
            + 'of the .NET security-related APIs are not safe to use by a casual .NET developer. This book tries to raise'
            + 'awareness of many important application security topics that most .NET developers are bound to run into.</p><p>The'
            + 'importance of understanding the challenges and pitfalls of application security is hard to underestimate. The'
            + 'security breaches are happening weekly if not daily, and their scope and magnitude continue to grow as users'
            + 'entrust (or are forced to entrust) more of their information to digital repositories and their'
            + 'operators.</p><p>When did you first become interested in application security?</p><p>I became interested in'
            + 'application security through a fascination with cryptography when I was 15 years old. I wrote an "unbreakable"'
            + 'XOR-based encryption mechanism in Turbo Pascal that I was very proud of. As laughable as it is now, I\'m sure many'
            + 'folks in the security field have a similar story to share. The writings of Bruce Schneier fueled my interest and'
            + 'made me realize that the information security domain is too focused on cryptographic tools and primitives, and not'
            + 'focused enough on how to use these tools to engineer secure systems.</p><p>By writing this e-book, did you learn'
            + 'anything new yourself?</p><p>I learned that application security and security in general are difficult topics to'
            + 'write about. Unlike basic things like math or computer science, application security is a rapidly moving and'
            + 'evolving field, with new threats, vulnerabilities, exploits, and countermeasures arriving nonstop. The prescriptive'
            + '"do X, Y, and Z to be safe" approach to security might work today, but is inadequate tomorrow. Rather than "giving'
            + 'readers a fish," I’ve tried to "teach them how to fish" in hopes that a foundational understanding of core concepts'
            + 'will provide longer-term value.</p><p>How will application security change over the next few years?</p><p>I think'
            + 'the security field has come to a threshold where it will start to be regulated. The amount of incompetence and'
            + 'negligence in this field is only matched by the magnitude of damages, and that creates a lethal combination that'
            + 'everyone in our digital economy suffers from. We already regulate doctors, lawyers, pilots, and many other'
            + 'professions, as well as organizations employing them.</p><p>I think that the regulatory changes will affect not'
            + 'only the technical in-the-field professionals, but will also impact the C-suite, and force senior leadership to'
            + 'give security pros a seat at the table. One of the highlights of this profound lack of senior-level understanding'
            + 'was in the Equifax Personnel-Change statement that followed the recent massive Equifax data breach. Equifax'
            + 'appointed a new Chief Security Officer (CSO), and made the CSO report to the CIO. When the just-been-breached'
            + 'Equifax does not understand why the CSO must report to the CEO and not the CIO, that\'s another sign that executive'
            + 'leadership still does not have the right perspective on security.</p><p>Another industry-wide change in perspective'
            + 'that I’m anticipating is a shift from “defend the castle” to “inmates are running the asylum.” Insider threats are'
            + 'already among the main security threats of 2017, and yet most security efforts are still just building'
            + 'walls.</p><p>Do you see the application security as part of a larger trend in software development?</p><p>I believe'
            + 'that thinking of application security as a larger trend in software development is like thinking of mathematics as'
            + 'a larger trend in physics, or thinking of backups as a larger trend in disaster recovery. Not everyone must be a'
            + 'highly skilled application-security professional, just like not everyone must be a highly-skilled accountant,'
            + 'lawyer, or engineer. Yet most IT companies rely on professional services of a relatively small number of skilled'
            + 'experts with unique domains of expertise. As software continues to "eat the world," software development as a field'
            + 'has long been vast enough and important enough to warrant domain specializations. Boeing does not advertise'
            + '"full-stack aerospace engineer" positions, and yet one of the core "career areas" for Boeing is "cybersecurity."'
            + 'Ten years ago, every company became a software company. In 2017, every software company must become a'
            + 'cybersecurity-focused company. Cybersecurity begins in the C-suite.</p><p>What other books or resources on'
            + 'application security do you recommend?</p><p>Microsoft’s Security Development Lifecycle book is a good read for'
            + 'software development managers and architects. Those interested in the foundations of cryptography may find Crypto'
            + '101 or the Serious Cryptography book suitable. Those interested in the fundamentals of TLS, the largest application'
            + 'of cryptography to the web, should check out Bulletproof SSL and TLS. Tangled Web is another favorite of mine,'
